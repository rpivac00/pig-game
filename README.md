## Rules and gameplay
At the beggining of the game one of the players is randomly selected as starting player.

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player's turn continues.
* If the player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

Game is over when one of the players gets 100 points
